# WORKDAY PLANNER

Week 5 challenge - Workday Planner

## Description

This is a workday planner that will let you save and delete tasks that need to be completed at different times throughout a normal workday schedule (9-5). If the box is gray the time is already in the past. If it is green it means the task is coming up. Finally red means the task is scheduled now
